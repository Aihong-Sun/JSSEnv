==============================

An optimized OpenAi gym's environment to simulate the [Job-Shop Scheduling problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/job_shop).

Getting Started
------------

To start working with this environment you simply need to clone and install it:

```shell
git clone LINK_TO_REPOSITORY
cd JSSEnv
python setup.py
```

Once installed, the environment will be available in your OpenAi's gym environment:

```python
import gym
env = gym.make('jss-v1', env_config={'instance_path': 'INSTANCE_PATH'})
```

### Important: Your instance must follow [Taillard's specification](http://jobshop.jjvh.nl/explanation.php#taillard_def).
